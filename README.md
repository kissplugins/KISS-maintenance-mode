**KISS = Keep It Simple (Stupid)** Plugins are designed to do one thing only. And we believe that one thing should be done very well.

The **KISS Maintenance** plugin (BETA) does not have any upsell or freemium features. You get it all.

**You get the folowing:**
1. On/Off Switch
2. Logo Upload
3. Headline Text
4. Contact Text
5. Page Background Color

There are no timers. You manually turn the Maintenance Mode splash screen to on **or** off yourself.

**Road Map**

Add Social Media Icons and links. 

After that we will probably stop with adding new features and focus on bug fixes for a long time.
