**KISS = Keep It Simple (Stupid)** Plugins are designed to do one thing only. And we believe that one thing should be done very well.

The **KISS Maintenance** plugin (BETA) does not have any upsell or freemium features. You get it all.

**You get the folowing:**
1. On/Off Switch
2. Logo Upload
3. Headline Text* 
4. Contact Text*
5. Page Background Color

*Color automatically changes with contrast detection feature built-in

There are no timers. You manually turn the Maintenance Mode splash screen to on **or** off yourself.

**Available Settings**

  Check this box to activate the splash page for non-logged-in users.

- **Splash Image**:  
  Click **Select or Upload Image** to open the WP media library and select a 500x500 (recommended) image. The field is read-only to ensure you use the media library.

- **Headline Text**:  
  Enter your custom headline. Defaults to **Under Construction** if blank.

- **Headline Font Size**:  
  Enter a numeric value only (e.g., **100** for 100px). The "px" is automatically added. If left empty, it defaults to **100px**.

- **Headline Font Family**:  
  Choose from the dropdown of available theme fonts.

- **Headline Alignment**:  
  Select **Left**, **Center**, or **Right**.

- **Contact Text**:  
  Add contact information or HTML (e.g., **Email us at `<a href="mailto:info@company.com">info@company.com</a>`**).

- **Contact Font Size**:  
  Enter a numeric value (e.g., **16** for 16px). The "px" is automatically added. Defaults to **16px** if empty.

  Select **Left**, **Center**, or **Right**.

- **Background Color**:  
  Use the color picker or enter a valid hex code (e.g., **#ffffff**) for the splash page background color.

**Saving Settings**

After making changes, click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the page. A confirmation message will appear indicating the settings are saved. If Maintenance Mode is enabled, you’ll be advised to use an incognito/private window and possibly clear caches to view the splash page as a visitor would.

**Viewing the Splash Page**

- **For Logged-In Users with Allowed Roles (Administrator, Editor, Author, Shop Manager)**:  
  The site will appear normally with the active theme’s pages visible.  
- **For Visitors and Other Users**:  
  The splash page will be displayed if Maintenance Mode is enabled.

To test your splash page, open your website in a browser where you’re not logged in or use an **Incognito/Private mode** window. You may need to clear your browser or server cache if you do not see the changes immediately.

**Disabling Maintenance Mode**

To disable maintenance mode and restore normal site visibility to all visitors, simply uncheck the **Enable Maintenance Mode** box and click **Save Changes**.

---

**Road Map**
- A few more extra fonts
- Add Social Media Icons and links. 

After that we will probably stop with adding new features and focus on bug fixes for a long time.
