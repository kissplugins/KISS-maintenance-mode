KISS = Keep It Simple (Stupid) Plugins are designed to do one thing only. And that one thing should be done very well.

This maintenance plugin does not have any upsell or freemium features. 

**You get the folowing:**
1. On/Off Switch
2. Logo Upload
3. Headline Text
4. Contact Text
5. Page Background Color

There are no timers. You manually turn this on or off yourself.

**Road Map**

Add Social Media Icons and links. 

After that we will probably stop with adding new features and focus on bug fixes for a long time.
